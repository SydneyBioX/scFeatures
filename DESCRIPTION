Description: scFeatures constructs multi-view representations of single-cell
             and spatial data. scFeatures is a tool that generates multi-view
             representations of single-cell and spatial data through the
             construction of a total of 17 feature types. These features can 
             then be used for a variety of analyses using other software in
             Biocondutor.
